==>  comparison with F<:
  It is a higher order system -> added in the last paragraph.
  Comparison could be added in 2.1 but its purpose is to introduce the idea of liquid types -- not to compare. 

*  terms 'e' diverges or crashed
 as the reviewer states, this can not happen in the formal language,
so should we clarify that in the overview section?

* adjusting the language about how automated we are (re: reviewer one)

* type aliases so you can now write:

{-@ type SparseVector a N = [({v: Int | (0 <= v && v < N)}, a)] @-}

I recall there was some mention that this would simplify the exposition of `Vec` in the paper, so we may as well do it...
